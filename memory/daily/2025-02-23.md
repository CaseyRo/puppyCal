# Daily Log — 2025-02-23

> Raw session notes, discoveries, and follow-ups. Promote to registers when durable.

## Decisions

- [12:00] Product name: PuppyCal. Stored durably in decisions register (rationale: clear, friendly-but-not-silly; alternatives Roo, Stabij considered; reverted to PuppyCal).

## Notes

- [14:30] When I say "commit": create a prod version first, then bump patch version, stage all changes, commit all changes, and push. (Full workflow to remember.)
- Total Recall memory system initialized.
- **puppyICS** context captured: quick-and-dirty solution for a puppy (in this case stabyhoun)—food scheme, walking schedule, and random breed info. Intention and current setup written to projects register and working memory.
- **js-webserver-ics spec ideas** (stored for later):
  - **Frontend**: JavaScript-based solution; simple standalone webserver (replace Python). Tailwind, form-based UI, mobile-first. ICS generation logic in the browser (client-side), not on the server.
  - **NFR**: ICS output must be compatible with Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail (RFC 5545). All options controllable via URL parameters and mirrored in the UI: dog date of birth, number of months for the plan, plan start date, birthday reminders on/off, optional content for the dog. UI form fields should read from and write to the same URL params.

## Follow-ups / Open loops

- (none)

## What we did today (2025-02-23)

- Initialized Total Recall memory (CLAUDE.local.md, memory/SCHEMA.md, registers, archive, daily log).
- Captured puppyICS project context: quick-and-dirty app for stabyhoun—food scheme, walking schedule, random breed info; wrote to projects register and working memory.
- Captured js-webserver-ics spec ideas: JS frontend + standalone webserver (replace Python), Tailwind, form UI, client-side ICS; NFRs for RFC 5545, URL params for DOB, months, start date, birthday reminders, optional dog content; form fields sync with URL.
